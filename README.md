Welcome to The Thirsty Cocktail, a bar open 24/hrs a day to help you choose a new exciting cocktail. You can input your alcohol of choice and then move through the catalogue of drinks in that category.

# How It's Made:
Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Cocktail API (https://www.thecocktaildb.com/api.php)

The website is built with HTML and CSS with Javascript used to add the interaction with the user and cocktail API. The user can enter their chosen alcohol and once submitted will fetch an array of drinks that match it. The name, ingredients, method, short description and image are then added to the DOM for the user to see. Using the 'Try another .. drink' button you can carousel through the drinks in the array.

Added extras: 

+ Created the GIF shaker animation to hide any slow loading responses from the fetch.
+ Depending upon the time of the day there will be a different welcome message.
+ The drink info container/info remains hidden until the data is fetched.


# The Future:
+ I like to be able to select drinks from a dropdown, so you are not relying on the user's knowledge of drinks.
+ Random/ Surprise drink selection.
+ Using local storage save a favourite list of drinks.

# Lessons Learned:
+ First working API
+ Consistent design/styling
+ How to carousel through an array.
